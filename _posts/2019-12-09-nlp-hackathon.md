- ### tokenizing, stemming 등 자연어 처리 툴로 서버/데이터베이스에 접근하여 주어진 언어를 탐색하고 PoS Tagging, NER, elastic search index 등을 수행하여 1위 팀으로 수상

- #### 주어진 시간 안에 팀원들이 함께 수행해야 하는 여건이었기 때문에, 나의 Main Role 은 Elastic Search Index 를 생성하여 test data document 와 분석 결과를 나타내었다

This is a full report of hackathon that our team was selected as best group and invited to Analytics Department Showcase. Our team identified the assigned language by accessing the server/database and conducted NLP procesing such as tokenizing, stemming. We also generated scores and labels for the document including Part of Speech(PoS) Tagging and Named Entity Recognition(NER). My main role was to create an elasticsearch index that represents our test data documents and includes the result of our analytic.
