- ### 이 프로젝트는 알코올과, 정신적/육체적 건강의 상관관계를 시각화를 통해 살펴본다.

This project is an individual portfolio(exam) that studies a relationship between alcohol and health. 
**The project explores a variety of factors and determines if alcohol affects our health mentally and physically.**
In this project, the aim is to answer questions such as: Is there a strong relationship between alcohol consumption and life expectancy? What about the corrleation between alcohol consumption and mental healthiness? Doesn't it give a temporary positive impact on our mood?
How is it different among beer, wine, and spirits? Do any other factors affect life expectancy?
